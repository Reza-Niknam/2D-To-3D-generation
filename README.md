# 2D-To-3D-generation
This repo is a feed-forward framework for converting 2D images into 3D models is presented, which utilizes a hybrid method including an off-the-shelf multiview diffusion model and a sparse-view reconstruction model based on the LRM architecture, enabling the rapid creation of diverse 3D models.
